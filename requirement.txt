Coding Exercise - The Ace of Spades Pizza Co.

Basic requirements:

Application name: The Pizza ordering Web App
We have a customer called "Ace Of Spades Pizza" who is expanding and needs a web application for customers to submit orders online. What is
amazing and particular at the same time about this client is that they only have 1 kind of pizza, they call it the "The One" and it is delicious!

The application we are building consists of 2 screens:
           1. The first screen will be the page where the clients can place the order. This page will be an HTML form that will have fields and a
               submit button. When clicking on the save button the data inputted into the form should be saved in a database. The screen should
               contain the following fields

                           The name of the person ordering,
                           The phone number
                           The date and time the pizza should be delivered
                           The number of pizzas being ordered
           2. Second screen will be a page that displays all orders that have been placed. This list should be ordered with the most current order at
               the top.

Technologies to use:

Basic technologies to be used are HTML, Asp.Net MVC with a MS-SQL database. If you want to use other complementing technologies please go
ahead.

Tools to download and use:

You can download Visual Studio Community edition here: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/
SQL server express can be used and downloaded here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52679

Extra points:

           1. If you have a link to see the application running (can use https://appharbor.com/ or azure)
           2. If we can differentiate your code from the default MVC starter template (if you are using it.)
           3. If you use a css framework
           4. If you use Entity Framework
           5. If you validate the form
           6. If the site looks nice
           7. If you use an IoC framework.
           8. If you add Unit Tests
           9. If you develop this as a SPA with AngularJs and WebAPI 2.0

Delivery:

The code should be checked in to your personal github repository. I do expect a few commits and not jut one gigantic commit with everything in it.

Timeline:

This project should not take more than 2 weeks. The faster you point me towards a working solution the better.
Happy coding =)
